  summary: Get payment details 
  description: >
    This endpoint will return the details of a specific open banking payment. You will need to enable PERM_BUSINESS_GET_PAYMENT to use this endpoint.


    As your customer goes through the payment submission journey, the payment status will change. The endpoint will return one of the following statuses:


    * `AWAITING_AUTHORISATION` - This is the initial status of all payments, indicating that the user has consented to be directed to their ASPSP/Bank's application. Payments remaining at this status may be considered abandoned.

    * `AWAITING_MULTI_AUTHORISATION` - Some business accounts require dual authorisation for payments.

    * `NOT_AUTHORISED` - This is a final status, and indicates that the payment initiation was cancelled by the customer, rejected by the ASPSP/Bank, an error response returned by the ASPSP/Bank, eg. low balance in the customers account.

    * `PENDING` - The customer has authorised the payment in their app, but their ASPSP/bank may want to carry out an internal check before funding the transaction.

    * `AUTHORISED` - The payment is successfully initiated, having been authorised by your customer and their ASPSP/Bank.


    Once the payment is successfully initiated, ie. `AUTHORISED`, the ASPSP/Bank should settle the funds, which are then applied to your Fire account.

    
    * `FUNDS_CONFIRMED` - This status is currently available for GBP payments only. The payment has been received by Fire and will be applied to your account in the next file run.

    * `SETTLED` - This is a final status, indicating that funds have been applied to your Fire GBP or EUR account.
