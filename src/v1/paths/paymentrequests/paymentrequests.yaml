  summary: Create a Payment request
  description: >
    This request creates a new Open Banking Payment request. A code is returned that can be shared to your customers as a URL by any channel you wish. See our [Guide to Fire Open Payments](/docs/fire-open-payments) for more details. You will need to enable the `PERM_BUSINESS_POST_PAYMENT_REQUEST` permission to use this endpoint. 
    The returnUrl variable should handle two scenarios, success and failure. Failure URLs are identified with a /return.
