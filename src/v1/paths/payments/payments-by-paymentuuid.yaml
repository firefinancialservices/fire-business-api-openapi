    * `NOT_AUTHORISED` - Either your customer clicked on cancel or the payment was rejected by their ASPSP / bank.

    * `PENDING` - This is the status that your payment is set to after the customer has authorised the payment with their ASPSP / bank but the bank may want to carry out another check before funding the transaction.
    
    * `AUTHORISED` - This is the status that your payment is set to after the customer has authorised the payment with their ASPSP / bank.
    
    * `PAID` - Funds were received into your fire.com GBP or EUR account from your customerâ€™s ASPSP / bank.
