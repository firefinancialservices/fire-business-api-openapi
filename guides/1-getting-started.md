## Seamlessly Integrate

Fire’s Business API documentation makes it simple to integrate and access the payment services you need. Our RESTful API uses JSON resource-based URLs so it’s fast, easy-to-use and secure.

The API provides read access to your profile, accounts and transactions, event-driven notifications of activity on the account and payment initiation via batches. Each feature has its own HTTP endpoint and every endpoint has its own permission.
